SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- At December 2017, the standardized firm characteristics (bm, mom12m, mve) show a wide range of values.
- Extreme values (above 2 or below -2) are observed for all characteristics, but momentum is less extreme.
- A simple value strategy (high bm) identifies a significant portion of the S&P 500.
- Combining value with negative momentum narrows the focus to potentially undervalued, out-of-favor firms.
- Conversely, low book-to-market and high momentum identifies expensive, high-performing firms.

BUY RULE:
if bm > 0.75 AND mom12m < -0.25:
        signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if bm < -0.5 AND mom12m > 0.75:
        signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
        signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY rule: This rule seeks to identify undervalued companies that are currently experiencing negative momentum. The rationale is that these companies may be temporarily out of favor but have the potential for future growth. The thresholds (bm > 0.75 and mom12m < -0.25) are chosen to balance the strength of the signal with the number of firms identified.
- SELL rule: This rule aims to identify overvalued companies that are currently exhibiting positive momentum. The rationale is that these companies may be overhyped and due for a correction. The thresholds (bm < -0.5 and mom12m > 0.75) are chosen to balance the strength of the signal with the number of firms identified.
- Expected signal distribution: The BUY rule is expected to generate signals for a smaller subset of companies, as it requires both value and negative momentum. The SELL rule is expected to generate signals for a similarly sized subset of companies, identifying those that are both expensive and have positive momentum. Most firms will fall under the HOLD rule.

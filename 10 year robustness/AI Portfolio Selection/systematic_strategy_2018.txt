Thought: 34 firms seems like a reasonable number for the short side. I will refine the thresholds a bit and finalize the rules.

===========================================
SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- Analyzed the distribution of book-to-market (bm), momentum (mom12m), and size (mve) for S&P 500 firms as of December 31, 2017.
- Identified extreme values for each characteristic using z-score thresholds.
- Explored combinations of characteristics to identify potential BUY and SELL signals.

BUY RULE:
if bm > 0.70 AND mom12m > 0.45:
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if bm < -0.45 AND mom12m < -0.45 AND mve < 0:
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule: The BUY rule identifies companies that are undervalued (high book-to-market ratio) and have positive momentum. These firms may be temporarily out of favor but have the potential for future growth. The thresholds are set to bm > 0.70 and mom12m > 0.45 to capture a reasonable number of undervalued, high-momentum stocks.
- SELL Rule: The SELL rule identifies companies that are overvalued (low book-to-market ratio), have negative momentum, and are relatively small in size. These firms may be at risk of further decline. The thresholds are set to bm < -0.45, mom12m < -0.45, and mve < 0 to capture a sufficient number of potentially overvalued, low-momentum, and smaller stocks.
- Expected signal distribution: The BUY rule is expected to generate signals for approximately 4-5% of the firms, while the SELL rule is expected to generate signals for approximately 6-7% of the firms. The remaining firms will be assigned a HOLD signal.

SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- The average values of bm, mom12m, and mve are close to zero, as expected due to standardization.
- Extreme values for bm range from approximately -1.7 to 3.3.
- Momentum values tend to cluster around the extreme positive value of 1.913758.
- Market capitalization (mve) ranges from approximately -2.2 to 2.8.

BUY RULE:
if bm > 1.0 AND mom12m > 0.7 AND mve > 0.0:
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if bm < -0.5 OR mom12m < -0.7 OR mve < -1.0:
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule:
    - Economic Reasoning: This rule identifies undervalued companies (high bm) with strong recent performance (high mom12m) and a reasonable market capitalization (mve above 0). This aligns with a value-momentum strategy, seeking to capitalize on undervalued stocks that are currently in favor with the market. The size filter helps avoid micro-cap stocks.
    - Thresholds:
        - bm > 1.0: Selects firms that are significantly undervalued compared to the market average.
        - mom12m > 0.7: Selects firms with strong positive momentum, indicating recent market favor.
        - mve > 0.0: Excludes the smallest firms, focusing on companies with a reasonable market presence.
- SELL Rule:
    - Economic Reasoning: This rule identifies overvalued companies (low bm), with weak recent performance (low mom12m) or very small market capitalization (mve below -1.0). These stocks are more likely to underperform in the future.
    - Thresholds:
        - bm < -0.5: Identifies firms that are relatively overvalued compared to the market.
        - mom12m < -0.7: Identifies firms with significant negative momentum, indicating poor recent performance.
        - mve < -1.0: Focuses on the smallest firms.
- Expected Signal Distribution:
    - I expect that the BUY rule will generate a small number of signals, focusing on high-conviction value-momentum opportunities.
    - The SELL rule is expected to generate a larger number of signals, reflecting the higher prevalence of overvalued or poorly performing stocks.
    - The HOLD rule will apply to the majority of stocks, representing the core of the market.

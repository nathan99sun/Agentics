SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- The dataset contains standardized values (z-scores) for market value of equity (mve), book-to-market ratio (bm), and 12-month momentum (mom12m) for S&P 500 firms as of December 31, 2018.
- Extreme values were explored for each characteristic using a threshold of 1.5 standard deviations from the mean.
- Different combinations of characteristics were tested using AND/OR logic to identify potential trading rules.

BUY RULE:
if (bm > 0.85 AND mom12m > -0.50) OR (bm > -0.25 AND mve > 1.25):
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if (bm < -0.70 AND mom12m < 0.50) OR (mom12m < -1.05 AND mve < 0.50):
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule:
    - (bm > 0.85 AND mom12m > -0.50): This condition identifies undervalued stocks (high book-to-market ratio) that have at least some positive momentum. The bm threshold of 0.85 aims to capture relatively undervalued firms, while the mom12m threshold of -0.5 filters out firms with strongly negative recent performance.
    - (bm > -0.25 AND mve > 1.25): This condition identifies larger companies (high market cap) that are not extremely overvalued. This rule is intended to capture more stable, larger companies that may be temporarily undervalued.
- SELL Rule:
    - (bm < -0.70 AND mom12m < 0.50): This condition identifies overvalued stocks (low book-to-market ratio) that don't have strong positive momentum. The bm threshold of -0.70 aims to capture relatively overvalued firms.
    - (mom12m < -1.05 AND mve < 0.50): This condition identifies smaller companies with strong negative momentum. The mom12m threshold of -1.05 aims to capture firms with severely negative recent performance.
- Expected signal distribution:
    - The BUY rule is expected to generate signals for a smaller subset of firms that exhibit value characteristics or a combination of size and value.
    - The SELL rule is expected to generate signals for a different subset of firms that are overvalued or have poor momentum, particularly among smaller companies.
    - The HOLD rule will apply to the majority of firms that do not meet the criteria for either BUY or SELL signals, reflecting a neutral outlook on these stocks.

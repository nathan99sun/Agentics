SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- The data includes standardized book-to-market (bm), momentum (mom12m), and market value of equity (mve) for S&P 500 firms as of December 2023.
- All features are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- Extreme values were explored to understand the distribution of characteristics.

BUY RULE:
if bm > 0.95 AND mve > 0.3 AND mom12m > -0.5:
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if (bm < -0.75 OR mom12m < -0.55 OR mve < -0.75) AND NOT (mom12m > 1.5):
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule: This rule targets undervalued (high bm), reasonably sized (mve > 0.3) companies with positive momentum (mom12m > -0.5). The economic intuition is to buy companies that are currently cheap but have shown some signs of recovery or positive market sentiment.
- SELL Rule: This rule aims to sell companies that are overvalued (low bm), have negative momentum (mom12m < -0.55), or are small in size (mve < -0.75). The `NOT (mom12m > 1.5)` condition prevents selling companies with extremely high momentum, even if they meet the other criteria, as these might be temporary situations or represent significant growth opportunities. The economic intuition is to avoid holding onto companies that are losing value or are too small to provide substantial returns, unless they are exhibiting exceptional positive momentum.
- Expected signal distribution: The BUY rule is expected to generate signals for a small percentage of firms (around 2%), focusing on higher-conviction value opportunities. The SELL rule is expected to affect a larger percentage of firms (around 50%), filtering out less desirable investments and managing risk. The remaining firms will be held.

SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- The dataset contains standardized values (z-scores) for book-to-market ratio (bm), 12-month momentum (mom12m), and log market value of equity (mve) for S&P 500 firms as of December 31, 2019.
- The average values for all characteristics are close to zero, as expected due to standardization.
- Extreme values (e.g., |z| > 1.5) indicate significant deviations from the mean for each characteristic.
- In December 2019, the market was trending upwards, so momentum strategies may be favored.

BUY RULE:
if (bm < -0.85 OR mom12m > 0.85) AND mve > 0.15:
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if ((bm > 0.95 OR mom12m < -0.95) AND mve < 0.05):
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule: This rule targets stocks that are either undervalued (low book-to-market ratio) or have strong recent performance (high momentum), and are of reasonable size. The thresholds are set to -0.85 and 0.85 respectively to capture a significant portion of the "value" and "momentum" universes. The size filter (mve > 0.15) is added to avoid very small, potentially illiquid stocks.
- SELL Rule: This rule aims to sell stocks that are either overvalued (high book-to-market ratio) or have poor recent performance (low momentum), and are relatively small in size. The thresholds are set to 0.95 and -0.95 respectively. The size filter (mve < 0.05) is included to focus on selling smaller, potentially riskier stocks that exhibit these negative characteristics.
- Expected signal distribution: We expect the HOLD signal to be the most frequent, as it represents the majority of stocks that do not meet the specific criteria for BUY or SELL. The BUY and SELL signals will be generated for a smaller subset of stocks exhibiting more extreme characteristics.

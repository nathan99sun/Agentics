SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- Data is standardized with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
- Explored extreme values ( > 2 or < -2) for bm, mom12m, and mve.
- Aim to create a value and momentum based strategy with a size consideration.

BUY RULE:
if bm > 0.70 AND mom12m > 0.50:
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if bm < -0.85 AND mom12m < -0.65:
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule: Buy undervalued stocks (high book-to-market ratio) with positive momentum. This combines value and momentum investing strategies. The thresholds are chosen to select a reasonable number of stocks (around 4%) for a diversified portfolio.
- SELL Rule: Sell overvalued stocks (low book-to-market ratio) with negative momentum. This avoids holding onto expensive stocks that are performing poorly. The thresholds are chosen to select a reasonable number of stocks (around 3%) for selling.
- Expected signal distribution: The strategy should generate buy and sell signals for a small percentage of stocks, with the majority being held. This allows for a focused portfolio of value stocks with positive momentum, while avoiding expensive stocks with negative momentum.

SYSTEMATIC TRADING RULES
===========================================

Data Exploration Summary:
- Examined extreme values of bm, mom12m, and mve at the end of December 2022.
- Identified potential thresholds for defining BUY/SELL signals based on value, momentum, and size.
- Tested combinations of characteristics using AND/OR logic to refine rule effectiveness.

BUY RULE:
if (bm > 0.8 AND mom12m > 0.6) OR (mve < 0.2 AND bm > 1.1):
    signal = BUY

SELL RULE:
if mom12m < -1.1 OR bm < -1.1:
    signal = SELL

HOLD RULE:
else:
    signal = HOLD

Rationale:
- BUY Rule:
    - (bm > 0.8 AND mom12m > 0.6): Buy undervalued stocks (high book-to-market) that also have positive momentum. This combines value and momentum factors. Thresholds chosen to balance signal strength and number of firms.
    - (mve < 0.2 AND bm > 1.1): Buy smaller companies (mve < 0.2) that are undervalued (high bm). This targets potentially overlooked value opportunities in smaller firms.
- SELL Rule:
    - mom12m < -1.1: Sell stocks with significantly negative momentum, as they are likely to continue underperforming.
    - bm < -1.1: Sell stocks that are extremely overvalued (very low book-to-market). These stocks may be overpriced and due for a correction.
- HOLD Rule:
    - All other cases: Hold existing positions unless they meet the criteria for buying or selling.
- Expected signal distribution:
    - The rules are designed to generate a reasonable number of BUY and SELL signals, leading to a diversified portfolio with a focus on value and momentum. The specific distribution will depend on market conditions.
